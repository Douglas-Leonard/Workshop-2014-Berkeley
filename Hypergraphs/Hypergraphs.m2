{*
	To do:
	- Add various other constructors:
		- list of vertices + list of edges (done)
		- list of edges (done)
		- hash table of form {a => {0,1}, ...} indicating vertex a belongs to edges 0 and 1, and so on
		- incidence matrix + automatically assigned vertex names (done)
		- incidence matrix + user provided vertex names
		- constructors similar to those in EdgeIdeals, ie, expecting a list of lists of variables, with each list of variables representing an edge
	- Rewrite the hypergraphVertexContainments and hypergraphNeighbors properties into lists, instead of hash tables; the hypergraphVertexContainments#0 should be the list of
		edge numbers to which hypergraphVertices#0 belongs
	- Add a hash table hypergraphVertexIndices to Hypergraph satisfying: 1 - its keys are the members of hypergraphVertices, and 2 - hypergraphVertexIndices#v returns the 
		position of vertex v in hypergraphVertices  (done)
	- Add a function returning the index of a vertex in hypergraphVertices  (done)
	- Overload the net function for the Hypergraph class
	- Add accessors:
		- vertices(Hypergraph)			- done
		- edges(Hypergraph)				- done
		- incidenceMatrix(Hypergraph)	- done
		- neighbors(Hypergraph, vertex) - done
	- Rewrite debug code to take into account the fact that the vertex and edge lists the user creates to define a Hypergraph may not be the same as the vertex and edge list 
		stored internally - use isSubset instead of ===  (done)
		
	Notes on Hypergraph constructor:
		- Repeated vertices and edges are ignored - this behavior is similar to that in the Graphs package, where uniqueness of vertices is enforced (but not for edges).  
			Consequently, the vertex and edge list a user creates to define a Hypergraph may not be the same as the vertex and edge list stored internally by the Hypergraph 
			class (and returned by vertices(Hypergraph) and edges(Hypergraph).  Moreover, the vertices in the edges in the internal edge list may not be listed in the same order 
			as the vertices in the edges in the edge list created by the user to define their Hypergraph
	
	Functions We Might Want to Include:
	From EdgeIdeals:
	- chromaticNumber
	- complementGraph
	- connectedComponents
	- numberConnectedComponents
	- hypergraphToSimplicialComplex
	- coverIdeal (This should maybe be of class MonomialIdeal?
	- edgeIdeal (Also MonomialIdeal?)		- done (returns a MonomialIdeal)
	- deleteEdges
	- independenceComplex
	- lineGraph
	- simplicialComplexToHypergraph
	- vertexCovers
	- vertexCoverNumber
	- isGraph
	- isCM
	- isSCM
	- isConnected
	- isForest
	- isLeaf

	From Nauty:
	- areIsomorphic
	- addEdges
	- generateHypergraphs
	
	Future priorities:
	- Implement weighted hypergraphs
	- Implement directed hypergraphs
