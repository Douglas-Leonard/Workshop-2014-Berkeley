   Headline
      for computations with Macaulay inverse systems	
   Description
      Text
         This package makes it possible to do computations with Macaulay inverse systems 
	 modules and ideals in a polynomial ring. 
      	  
      Example
    
   Caveat
      The package uses the contraction action of the polynomial ring on itself.

   Headline 
      computes the submodule annihilating an inverse system
   Usage 
      N = newFromDual(F)
   Inputs
      F:Matrix 
         F is a matrix where the columns are the generators of an inverse system in   
	 the inverse system of a free module. 
   Outputs
      N:Matrix
         N is a presentation matrix for the module that has F as its inverse system.
   Description
      Text
      
      Example 
         F = matrix(QQ[x,y,z],{{x^4,y^4},{z^4,x^2*y^2}})
         N = newFromDual(F)
      Text 
         The command {\tt newFromDual} extends the command {\tt fromDual} so that it also 
         works for modules.
