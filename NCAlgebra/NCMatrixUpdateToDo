This file contains a list of the methods that take or return NCMatrices 
still needing to be updated to handle the zero module.

"Lower the zero module!"

 Methods that use an object of class NCMatrix :
     ==============================================


       * "NCMatrix % NCGroebnerBasis" -- Reduces the entries of an NCMatrix with respect to an
         NCGroebnerBasis

       * "NCMatrix // NCMatrix" -- Factor one map through another

       * NCMatrix == ZZ, see "NCMatrix == NCMatrix" -- Test equality of matrices
       IS AN EMPTY MATRIX EQUAL TO ZERO?

       * NCRingMap NCMatrix, see "NCRingMap NCRingElement" -- Apply an NCRingMap to an element
         or matrix

       * rightKernel(NCMatrix,ZZ), see "rightKernel" -- Method for computing kernels of
         matrices over noncommutative rings in a given degree without using Bergman

       * rightKernelBergman(NCMatrix), see "rightKernelBergman" -- Methods for computing
         kernels of matrices over noncommutative rings using Bergman


 Functions and methods returning an object of class NCMatrix :
     =============================================================

       * "basis(ZZ,NCIdeal)" -- Returns a basis of an NCIdeal in a particular degree.
       * "basis(ZZ,NCLeftIdeal)" -- Returns a basis of an NCLeftIdeal in a particular degree.
       * "basis(ZZ,NCRightIdeal)" -- Returns a basis of an NCRightIdeal in a particular degree.

       * "sparseCoeffs List"

       * make it so the zero matrix over a commutative ring can act on an NCMatrix
