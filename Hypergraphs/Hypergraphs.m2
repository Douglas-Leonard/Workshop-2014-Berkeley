}

{*
	To do:
	- add various other constructors (contructors accepting incidence matrix (done), list of edges (done))
	- overload the net function for the Hypergraph class
	- Add accessors:
		- vertices(Hypergraph)
		- edges(Hypergraph)
		- incidenceMatrix(Hypergraph)
		- neighbors(Hypergraph, vertex)

	Functions We Might Want to Include:
	From EdgeIdeals:
	- chromaticNumber
	- complementGraph
	- connectedComponents
	- numberConnectedComponents
	- hypergraphToSimplicialComplex
	- coverIdeal (This should maybe be of class MonomialIdeal?
	- edgeIdeal (Also MonomialIdeal?)
	- deleteEdges
	- independenceComplex
	- lineGraph
	- simplicialComplexToHypergraph
	- vertexCovers
	- vertexCoverNumber
	- isGraph
	- isCM
	- isSCM
	- isConnected
	- isForest
	- isLeaf

	From Nauty:
	- areIsomorphic
	- addEdges
	- generateHypergraphs
	
	Future priorities:
	- Implement weighted hypergraphs
	- Implement directed hypergraphs
